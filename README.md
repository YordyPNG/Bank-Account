# Bank-Account
Do you have $1000 or more in your bank account(s)?

If you do and want to filter out your bank account then this project is for you. 

It checks whther your balance in your bank account is $1000 or more and if is, it will output your bank account's name. If not, it will be filtered out and will not output.
